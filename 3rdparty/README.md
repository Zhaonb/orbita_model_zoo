# Quick Start Driver Build Guide
This memo provides a quick overview and basic guidance for building Vivante VIP and 3D driver software. For additional detail, refer to the readme files and example build scripts provided with the driver as well as the Vivante Driver Development Guide and other documentation provided with your driver packages.

Note: Depending on your IP design (3D only, 3D+VX, VIP or 3D+VIP), the GAL suffix in your package name may contain GAL_, GALVIP_ or GAL3D.

## Quick Start Build Instruction for VIP Driver
This driver is compatible with VIP or 3D+VIP hardware. Do not install this driver for 3D+VX or 3D only IP. 
### Step 1. Install the driver packages in the following sequence.
1)	VIVANTE_GAL_Unified_Src_drv_<version>.tgz
2)	VIVANTE_GAL_Unified_Src_drv_OVX-addon_<version>.noGPL.org.tgz
3)	VIVANTE_GAL_Unified_Src_drv_OCL-addon_<version>.tgz
4)	VIVANTE_GAL_Unified_Src_drv_<customer>-prebuilt-addon_<version>.tgz (this is a prebuilt addon of the online compiler, which is generated via toolchain of target platform)
5)	VIVANTE_GALVIP_Unified_Src_drv_OVXLIB-addon_<version>.tgz (this is OVXLIB source code)
6)	VIVANTE_GALVIP_Unified_Src_drv_<gpu_config>_VXC_addon_<version>.tgz (this is a prebuilt addon of VX files which are generated by the offline compiler; use compile option “TARGET32” to select 32/64 bits of prebuilt VXC kernel to match the target platform)
7)	VIVANTE_GALVIP_Unified_Src_drv_<customer>_<feature>-addon_<version>.tgz
(install any addition customer specific packages provided)

### Step 2. Refer to $(AQROOT)/release/SW/ReadMe_Linux.txt for details on building the driver.
a.	Be sure the following key options are set:
- VIVANTE_ENABLE_3D=1   
- VIVANTE_ENABLE_2D=0   
- VIVANTE_ENABLE_VG=0

b.  Select prebuilt binary types. If compiler modules are licensed, this variable is not necessary. 

- FIXED_ARCH_TYPE=<prebuilt_folder_name>   

c.	Additional options for VIP driver build command.
- USE_VXC_BINARY=1	//Enable using prebuilt vxc kernel
- GPU_CONFIG=<ip_config>	//Specify the target HW config (e.g., vipnanodi_pid0x9F)
- TARGET32=1	//Default VXC kernel is set to 64bits, use this option to set VXC kernel to 32 bits when target platform is 32 bits
Build command syntax example:
- make -f makefile.linux <options> USE_VXC_BINARY=1 GPU_CONFIG=vipnanodi_pid0x9F
<TARGET32=1>
### Step 3. Refer to the example build scripts located at ${AQROOT} to set up your build script for building GALVIP driver.
- driver_build_sample.sh driver_build_sample_fb.sh

## Quick Start Build Instruction for 3D Driver
This driver is compatible with 3D only, 3D+VX and 3D+VIP hardware. Some modules are not needed for 3D only hardware.
### Step 1. Install the driver packages in the following sequence.
1)	VIVANTE_GAL3D_Unified_Src_drv_<version>.tgz
2)	VIVANTE_GAL3D_Unified_Src_drv_DRI-addon_<version>.noGPL.org.tgz
3)	VIVANTE_GAL3D_Unified_Src_drv_DRM-addon_<version>.org.tgz
4)	VIVANTE_GAL3D_Unified_Src_drv_EXA-addon_<version>.org.tgz
5)	VIVANTE_GAL3D_Unified_Src_drv_GL4-addon_<version>.noGPL.org.tgz
6)	VIVANTE_GAL3D_Unified_Src_drv_LIBDRM-addon_<version>.org.tgz
7)	VIVANTE_GAL3D_Unified_Src_drv_OVX-addon_<version>.noGPL.org.tgz (not required for 3D only IP)
8)	VIVANTE_GAL3D_Unified_Src_drv_OCL-addon_<version>.tgz
9)	VIVANTE_GAL3D_Unified_Src_drv_<customer>-prebuilt-addon_<version>.tgz (this is a prebuilt addon of the online compiler, which is generated via toolchain of target platform)
10)	VIVANTE_GAL3D_Unified_Src_drv_OVXLIB-addon_<version>.tgz (not required for 3D only IP)
11)	VIVANTE_GAL3D_Unified_Src_drv_<customer>_<feature>-addon_<version>.tgz
(install any addition customer specific packages provided)

### Step 2. Refer to $(AQROOT)/release/SW/ReadMe_Linux.txt for details on building the driver.
a.	Be sure the following key options are set: VIVANTE_ENABLE_3D=1 VIVANTE_ENABLE_2D=0 VIVANTE_ENABLE_VG=0  
b.	Select prebuilt binary types. If compiler modules are licensed, this variable is not necessary.
FIXED_ARCH_TYPE=<prebuilt_folder_name>

Example build command syntax:  
make -f makefile.linux <options>

### Step 3. Refer to the example build scripts located at ${AQROOT} to set up your build script for building GAL3D driver.
